# Who are we

**KUBA, MARCIN**, about ourselves, backgrounds

**About the company:** 

**MARCIN, KUBA**

As a company, Tokenika is a group of blockchain and DLT technology enthusiasts with a long track record. Most of us have been around the scene for many years, either as early adopters/investors, or sometimes developers and nerds trying to change the world. As the scene matured, so did the actions around it, which led to creation of a company. Currently it is a well funded team of roughly a dozen people from different backgrounds, from coding, law, artificial intelligence, blockchain and asset trading. 

# What we are doing

**MARCIN**

Currently Tokenika is exclusively focused on making EOS happen - our efforts are aimed at becoming block producer and then developing the ecosystem to the best of our abilities.

We are experienced in running a node, as GTG is a friend and advisor and has helped us set up the infrastructure.

Talk about projects

Since we are a software development house already working on several EOSprojects, we’ve extensively dipped our hands into working with code and figuring out what's what in EOS -

Internal tools:

-	EOS Projects
-	EOS Factory
-	EOS Probe

External dApps:

-	Sygnet

Public presentations, meetups in Poland and abroad.

**MARCIN**

Business support, blockchain consulting, also for government agencies.

We’re scalable, also with workforce, Aply on standby. 

Testnet - our node is one of the few that our still alive.

**in the future**

Incubation possibility

Further collaborations, Parsec (Vitual smart contracts), SendGold, PowerBee etc, coding academy.

# Why

Forma luźniejsza, możemy sobie wchodzić w słowo:

What additionally united us was a fondness of the DPOS concept, as a workable governance model for scalable blockchains. Being early adopters of BTC and then ETH it was an ongoing worry that due to massive power overhead and dismal speeds of these giants, this is only a transition phase. We were very early acquainted with Chris Odom’s open transactions, a hashgraph like payment system, and after discussing the details with him in Amsterdam around 2013, we thought that the scaling problem will be the ultimate make it or break it when it comes to decentralising anything. The ideology is all very cool, but people want a working product, that’s all that matters.

When Dan Larimer rolled out his first incarnation of DPOS, the BTSx, as flawed as it was, we reacted very enthusiastically as it seemed to have addressed most of the gripes we had with the leading blockchains at that time. It took a couple of years for the tech to mature up to the introduction of Graphene, but looking at where we’re at right now, it seems that DPOS is the only actually usable public blockchain tech out there (Cryptokitties case and BTC fees and power consumeption - rest the case)

O pragmatyzmie Larimera…

# Where

The operation is ran from Warsaw Poland, although some of us work remotely, as is typical.

# When

We have a very long track record with DPOS, dating way ahead before the inception of EOS, although more as individuals, than the company. Nevertheless, Tokenika has been posting and educating about EOS since around September 2017, and as such we are one of the earliest people that actually got their hands dirty with understanding, testing and coding. 

**The roadmap for the upcoming months is roughly:** 

- Development of apps already in the pipeline.
- Securing the Block producer status to enable us to scale our operations and support for the ecosystem
- Setting up additional enterprises around the EOS witness, as mentioned before.
