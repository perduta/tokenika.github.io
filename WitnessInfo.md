# 3. TECH SPECS

> Estimate of technical specifications and total expenditure for resources by June 3, 2018 - posted to Steem blockchain. Check mark given for any estimate, modesty encouraged by permanent Steem record. Quality and accuracy of effort will be judged by the EOS community.

- We are using tier 3+ datacenters across Poland in 3 different cities with plenty of room for growth (20-40 rack units in each). Available now, more if needed.
- Tier datacenter standards are described [here](https://www.colocationamerica.com/data-center/tier-standards-overview.htm).
- We'll have 3 main servers: *Nike*, *Wawel* & *Hanys* (Dual Xeon E5-2687W with 512GB RAM ECC DDR4). Plus a bunch of other boxes powering our base infrastructure. 
- That gives 24 cores (48 threads) per machine for a total of 72 cores or 144 threads, which powered by up to 3.5GHz gives excellent single-core performance.
- At least two of them will be available from day one to deal with our basic needs.
- They served us well for months, we are switching from SSDs to NVMes, as their base storage and adding some RAM.

# 4. SCALING PLAN

> Estimated scaling plan for hardware after June 3, 2018 - posted to Steem blockchain. Rough outlines receive a check mark, open review gauges the effort.

- Actually it's not the hardware specs that make us feel ready for EOS launch. It's the ability to scale rapidly. We are expecting the unexpected.
- We are partnered with external infrastructure providers ready to boost our processing power within minutes. Thus, in the event of very heavy loads, we are able to expand our datacenter capacity by orders of magnitude in near real-time.
- Additionally, we plan to use cloud solutions, including SDDC (software-defined datacenter).
- Initially, when nobody knows what the actual demand for processing power is going to be, we'll be to some degree dependent on our partners (i.e. external providers). However when the dust settles (most probably by September), we'll be operating our own machines and relying less on external partners, while still keeping a close relationship with them to be able to scale quickly.

# 5. COMMUNITY BENEFIT

> Community benefit project outline, only for projects expected to be public by June 3, 2018 - posted to Steem blockchain.

As a software house and an EOS decicated incubator, we are currently involved in development of several projects for the EOS blockchain. These are:
* [EOSPROJECTS](https://eosprojects.org), a comprehensive listing of all tools and initiatives making up the EOS ecosystem.
* EOS Block Explorer, not only explorer but also a tool for monitoring witnesses' performance, similar to Steem's [SteemDB](https://steemdb.com).
* [EOSFACTORY](https://github.com/tokenika/eosfactory.io), a framework for compiling, testing and deploying EOS smart-contracts, similar to Ethereum's [Truffle Framework](http://truffleframework.com).
* [SYGNET] EOS-based digital identity system.

We have a proven track record in supporting the EOS community since it's beginnings that can be verified here, on our Steem profile and our Github profile. We have spoken at conferences and meetups promoting EOS, been a heavy supporter of Dan Larimer's projects since early days of Bitshares (around 2013) and have regularly contributed to promotion of EOS since it's inception. Our team members manage one of the best performing Steem witness nodes, consistently scoring in the top 3 for the least amount of dropped blocks. This separates us from other witness candidates with no track record or expertise, with a history of a only a few posts, dating several weeks back at best. 

We are also aware of the utilitarian role of a witness node, and in the event of a high surplus of income from the witness voting, we are planning to set up a transparent, blockchain auditable software incubator that redistributes a certain percentage of the witness income towards finding and promotion of most interesting startups. The precise formula of this will be worked out when the economics of an EOS witness node become more clear.
