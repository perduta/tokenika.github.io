and I don't get to leave yet because

I've got to talk about block producers

that's part one now onto part two okay

block producers so delegate a proof of

stake a little bit more about that proof

of work indicates proof of work assumed

that everybody was known now if

everybody is known sorry unknown

everybody's unknown when people are

unknown we have to control them by this

mechanism called hashing it's got to be

done through cryptography and

probability is really quite difficult

and very expensive but we can reverse

that what happens if we know everybody

who's going to be a block producer in a

community context so that and this is

what depose or delegated proof of stake

does it assumes that we know who the

block producers are and it then splits

the job into two different layers when

we know who the block producers are we

can actually construct software which is

very efficient but the problem of course

is that a block producer could then

produce a bad block so we need a way to

correct for that process and depose with

it's two layers the first layer is the

production layer and in this we've got

21 block producers in a ring and this is

a number that was found from experience

with bitshares and steam it if you go to

much higher it starts to get very

inefficient if you go to much lower you

start to lose the benefits of

decentralization so 21 is a good number

each producer in turn produces one block

to make around and at the end of every

round we shuffle that round then on top

of that we create the governance layer

and this is the notion where the

community because we define the

community earlier with the Constitution

the community places its AOS into stake

and it therefore can now vote for its

block producers every round there's a

new election this is every minute so you

don't actually get to

see this happening because you're not

paying that much attention but it's all

happening in the software so every

minute there's a chance to vote in and

out the block produces it's been proven

in bitshares and steam

bitches itself has been running for two

year three years now and we're improving

the mechanism in a OS that IO but it's

essentially the same thing as far as

block producers are concerned with the

addition of the Constitution the block

producer is in agreement is a party to

the Constitution and with the addition

of arbitration the block producer

likewise is under arbitration so what

does the block producer actually do well

five things in sequence builds a server

standard internet machine installs the

software and configures it for block

production then just join a network

there emit there are several test

networks available to play around with

or you join up with some buddies or

something like that and then you produce

blocks that's all it is at a technical

level there's a bit more - at those

self-governance is very important one

block producer amongst twenty one could

decide to do something wrong could

decide to let through a bad transaction

this bad transaction would then be

followed by other block producers or not

so one block producer we've seen to be

pushing an invalid block will probably

be rejected by the following block

producers for something to go through we

need a two-thirds majority which means

we need quite a few block producers to

consult to cohort or to transpire to

create a bad transaction so then we need

a sense of block producers coming

together and actually deciding because

there's going to be some times such as

code changes or Constitution changes or

various other things where we do need

the block producers to approve a message

which was not acceptable purely to the

software and for this purpose they will

run their own forum the block producers

will be chatting to each other and

watching

it's going on so when something pops up

when a new change is needed they can

talk about that and reach that

two-thirds majority and start to make it

happen but the community is sitting

there watching ultimately the block

producers are covered by the

Constitution and they have to follow the

rules the Constitution will select and

create or authorize a manual for the

block producers which will give them

their precise documentation now to a

large extent they'll be able to change

their manual but to get the manual

changed they'll then have to put it back

to the community to vote it through so

they're not entirely in control of their

destiny but certainly at the detail

level they'll be looked at to rewrite

their manual as from time to time

they'll also have to deal with rulings

resolve any disputes the rulings will

tell them to do things like accept a bad

transaction in the network and

occasionally law will pop up as well at

the individual operation producer level

there are exceptions where they will

actually have to allow transactions to

go through three exceptions emergencies

will happen at that point it's an

emergency it's happening fast the block

producers shall be expected to talk

amongst themselves and rapidly put in

place a change and now we're talking

about something like the Dow or a major

theft or something's gone wrong such as

block blocks are starting to compete

with each other

that won't happen very often then the

community will sometimes vote on a

change to the code of the Constitution

and that will require the block

producers to confirm that change and

finally arbitration will provide a

ruling and that ruling will instruct

block producers and others potentially

to make certain changes so all of this

is mediated by this internal forum that

they run let's talk about incentives the

block producers get paid in rewards from

the system each time they print a block

they get a small slice of rewards for

that payment to stick

it must get through the two-thirds

majority if it doesn't get through a

two-thirds majority if their block is

kicked out then they don't get paid so

there's a good incentive to make sure

you're following the right recipe the

the total amount of incentives paid out

to the block producers is limited in the

Constitution there'll be a line that

says block producers get paid X percent

per year divided across the field we've

talked about 5% in the past recently

there's been a discussion about 1% so

how much is that let's use a scratch pad

here I don't know what the price of Eos

is but let's say it's $6 that gives us

about 6 billion from 1 billion tokens

which means about 300 million dollars

per year 15 million per block producer

per year and the thing that should

strike you is that's a lot of money it's

actually way too much it's way too much

money even if it was 1% at 3 million

dollars a year that's too much so we

have a surplus what are we going to do

with that surplus we're going to return

the surplus the excess money back to the

community which is going to propose

worker proposals and these we voted in

order and the block producers will be

invited to share the extra with the

worker proposals now we have to recall

that the community can vote out the

block producers at any time so we have

this feedback loop whereby the community

watches how much the block producers are

returning which they decide themselves

but if block producers vote to keep too

much money the community will say this

is not good enough we'll vote you out

we'll put in some block producers which

are more efficient how much we can we

can compare this question of how much

money - the cost base of a block

producer so what's it gonna cost to run

a block producer well I could do it at

home with a fiber link on a Mac Mini at

least for a while and that's going to

cost me about a thousand dollars per

year but there are some people who are

putting together redundant data centers

and they're employing professional dev

cops and lawyers and they're putting

huge machines in place and this might be

costing them a million dollars a year

how much is it going to cost

we don't know it's going to be somewhere

between a big number and a small number

and this time next year we'll have a

much better idea so your guess is as

good as anybody's guess decentralization

is really important there is an

assumption in depots and in proof of

work and in all of these systems that it

has to be decentralized it

decentralisation is there for a purpose

it souls for lots of attacks if there is

only one server or a few server there's

lots of ways to attack the system and

there's a list of them we don't need to

go through them you're familiar with

them from the literature most of these

risks are solved by software and

cryptography and careful design but

every one of these designs today in a

blockchain assumes decentralization and

independence so we're looking for

diversity in block producers we need to

diversify across internet connections

across the physical locations around the

globe

we would like to diversify the

jurisdictions so that we get fairness

across the globe cultures different

cultures can be also come into it

because in practice what happens is

opposing cultures will give us more

strength than cultures that are

completely aligned so there are 200

countries out there we'd love to hear

from all of them there's lots of

continents there's different fashions of

law which are competing and there's also

the sense of technologies we've got the

possibility in the future of different

code bases different styles of machines

does anybody remember Spector and

meltdown they attacked and compromised

every machine architecture except one

the Raspberry Pi the smallest of the

machines was not affected by those guys

so we want that resilience and we want

independence which means that

the developers and the arbitrators and

the block producers and any other

important role should not be the same

now does this mean that these people

cannot run two jobs I would say so

but as a community member I would vote

that way and we have to find the balance

what we're looking for is a sense that

independence is required for important

roles where all of our community our

businesses our money is on the line

here's a quick sense of how - not very

well filled out basically go and join

that list there vos pros on telegram and

ask them the questions there is a how-to

which I haven't got there build a team

to do this this is not something you can

do easily by yourself I would but you

shouldn't and join a subnet and get

going and good luck
