# The governed blockchain: the blockchain for business is the blockchain that solves the black swan

Let's let's build a blockchain. What does it take to build a blockchain? We want a blockchain for everybody and we have to figure out what that means. So we have to go back to first principles and think about this: what does everybody do? Who is everybody and what is the thing that they need? And of course, can we provide it?

Our assumption is that everybody are traders. And therefore a blockchain for trade is what we need. So what do we do if we're building for business, building for trade?

Well, we know that we can put businesses on a blockchain because it's been done. We've got Steem and we've got BitShares and they're both businesses which work, in a fundamental sense, on the blockchain. If you map them out in their quadrants, they're very very different businesses, but they're both using the same principles. So we've got good principles and a wide-open space between them, so that's opportunity.

If we summarize the way blockchains work today, we've got two basic forms:

* unpermissioned blockchains
* and permissioned blockchains.

The unpermissioned blockchains are basically designed to do simple automation only. They use this metaphor of a smart-contract to do code, to organize simple contractual mechanisms to work. And consequently, as a sort of response to the simplicity of the code that is out there, you see a lot of attention in the blockchain community on things like smart-contracts and external oracle-style logic to feed information in, multisig, zk-snarks - all this wonderful stuff, but when it comes to the actual business, what we really see is a bit of a wild west: we see anarchy.

And to control this, banks and large institutions try create an alternative: the permissioned blockchain, which works from the basis of creating what we call a walled garden: you can get in only if you're permitted in.

Now, the problem that occurs with the walled garden is that having been allowed in, you end up having to be exposed to a gatekeeper. A wall always has a gate and the gate always has a gatekeeper. And now, the gatekeeper will eventually decide to raise fees as time goes on. So eventually you get the situation where the fees are going up, the insiders are controlling the situation and the rules are changing to suit the insiders and the small business gets locked out. And after a while you get what Michael Minnelli calls indolence & corruption because of this sense of cartelization.

Now, we do agree with what the blockchain provides us with automation at the bottom. What we don't agree with is what happens above the blockchain layer. So what does a small business do in that circumstance? To answer that we need to figure out what it is that business actually does.

For the different businesses that are out there are two options:

* If you are a very large mega corporation your best opportunity is to do exactly what you're doing now. Stick where the money is.
* If you are a high net-worth individual your best opportunity is to buy assets and hold them.

Whereas for the rest of us, if we're not the mega corporation and if we're not the high net-worth individual, we have to trade. We have to trade to do business to make profits. The smaller business we are, the smaller the business we have to trade more and more into complexity. And there's a very interesting reason for that: where there's complexity there's lots of errors which leads to unpredictability. And if it's unpredictable that means there's a need to take care and your customer wants you to take care and he'll pay you more profits to take care in an unpredictable world. If it was the other way around, if it was simple, it would be automated and the small business will be squeezed out of the business. So we like complexity, we like errors, we like a risky business.

But we don't like too much. Unpredictability means there's a lot of things which can go wrong and especially if you talk about blockchain - there's all sorts of bad things going on, as I'm sure you know.

So one way to think about unpredictability is risk. We're essentially doing risk management. How do we do this? If we think about, for example, insurance we can cover the risk. If we think about security we can avert the risk, reduce the risk from actually happening. Once the risk has come through and happened we can think about legal situations, such as courts, to resolve it. The businessman gets used to that process eventually.

But what does IT think about risk? We can go through certain standard risk models and talk about big risks and small risks and so forth, but I like this particular diagram, which leaves us with a very big risk that happens very infrequently. It's got a lot of cost but it happens very infrequently.

The problem with that is because we don't see it very often, we believe it's not going to happen and the IT industry is poorly prepared for this sector. What we don't see, we don't code up.

Now, we call these the black swans. They're only happening in theory. They never happen in practice. But it turns out the blockchain has a lot of these going on, an awful lot of them, and I'm sure you've read about all these, so I won't go through them.

How does the entrepreneur face the black swan? Face this thing where going into the blockchain means that they would put all their capital in there at risk and discover that tomorrow all this money they've spent, all these developers they've employed, all of the effort they've put in, the cash and the time, has gone to naught because their business has been raided by one of these black swans.

I would put it to you that the question is: why would an entrepreneur invest in a business on the blockchain if there were black swans? And I would say that the big money in the world is sitting on the sidelines because of this problem. Because blockchain is too dangerous in the perception of the ordinary businessman, so therefore **our proposition is that the blockchain for business is the blockchain that solves the black swan**.

So how do we solve for this black swan? Probably the answer is going to be something to do with trust. We know that the problem with trust is that we need many trades. Game theory and various theories tell us that we need lots and lots of rounds with no end in sight, it's got to keep going, it's got to be business that keeps going. We've got to have shared profit in every round and we've also got to have a mechanism for punishing people who've done the wrong thing. If something goes really wrong and we know that somebody's being aggressive there needs to be a way to control that process.

So we're in it for a lot of trades, not just today's trade but every trade. We could also look at this from different theories. Negotiation theory says that we want win-win, not win-lose. Game theory says we want a net-positive game, not a zero-sum game.

It turns out that the entrepreneur and blockchain today wants these things at the top, win-win / net-positive game, but what they get in win-lose the, a zero-sum game.

If you look at the way blockchains work today, and now we're talking about Etherium and Bitcoin and so forth, they've actually been very successful in the zero-sum or win-lose game. The automation that has happened below the line has been so successful, the community has thought or believed or assumed that that's the way everything should be: we should be doing win-lose, zero-sum games but in practice that's not how business is. This is how the blockchain community behaves. So currently if you look at the businesses that are out there, the dApps and so forth, they are actually zero-sum games, at least most of them. If you think about, for example currencies or ICOs, they're moving money from one place to another. Gaming is moving money from one place to another. And if you think about that, you're not actually creating or producing any new value. In comparison to Steem which is creating new value by distributing the good posts of people to other people - that is the actual new value.

Because of this effect that win-win is what we want and the zero-sum game is what we're building for, we have created a toxifying effect in blockchain. For example, if you want to get ahead in a trade, well let's do a DDoS. If you want to get ahead with a contract, you can hack the contract and there are no consequences to this. So over time this builds up to be a normal sort of behavior.

Whereas an entrepreneur actually wants the alternative. **The entrepreneur wants a business where they can deal with people and build profits, not extract profits**.

Just to summarize what we're looking for. We're looking for this repeated, no-end-in-sight game, we want to remember who we are dealing with, we need rules of the game, we need a way to trade and we need to way to hold the aggressor to account. And if that's our complete list, that doesn't quite look like an ordinary unpermissioned blockchain like Etherium but it doesn't look like the permissioned blockchain either. There's no wall there. 

If we compare these two worlds side-by-side, we find actually the three requirements down the bottom are the same thing, but the ones at the top are different which allows us to say: the wall is the problem, let's tear down the wall, we don't need it. What we do need to add is a way of knowing who we're dealing with because of this notion of doing rounds of trade, trade after trade after trade, so we need to know who that person is. But the identity topic is a really big topic, a really important topic, but it's way beyond the scope of today's talk.

So how do we build this governed blockchain? Well we do it in two layers. We need a set of rules, or constitution, and that constitution applies when you enter into the blockchain. So what happens technically speaking is that the transactions that you send to the blockchain include a copy of the constitution by means of a hash of the document. That's that cryptographic message-digest thing, the big long scary number. That goes into the packet and that indicates you have agreed to the constitution.

Now, having agreed to the constitution we have now defined a community: **the community is the people who have agreed to the constitution**. Which means if you are in the community and I am in the community I can rely on you having agreed to the constitution. That's really useful.

The architecture that we've adopted this delegated proof of stake, which I'll talk about a little bit more in the next section, allows us to do several things.

* It offers referenda. A referendum can be created to change the code, or to change the constitution. It's important to understand that you, the community, having agreed to the constitution and joined the EOS blockchain will be able to change your own constitution - you get to own the constitution.
* It also allows us to set arbitration and appoint arbitrators to solve problems.

In summary, the entrepreneur is looking for win-win, but the entrepreneur gets win-lose. How do we reverse that situation? Well, the unpermissioned blockchain is more about the construction of zero-sum / win-lose trades, it's about taking the value from the other person this is not really a good mix. Whereas the permissioned one concentrates on blocking people out and the ones that are inside can agree to trade, but the problem is the good trade is actually small business. **You can't have a vibrant growing economy without small business**.

So we need the freedom of the first option, but the protection of the other option. 

**EOS is that third choice, the governed blockchain. In essence what we have is the rules of behavior, as provided for by the constitution, and we have free entry taken from the the unpermissioned blockchain, free entry is still preserved**.

So we now have the best of both worlds.

And the difficulty here is that wall. **The fallacy is that we need a wall. Actually we don't need a wall. What we need is controls**.

The governed blockchain is produced of two layers:

* The bottom layer we have members agreeing to the constitution on entry which sets the basic norms of behavior.
* On top of that we can use those rules to resolve the difficulties that we call the black swan, we can have arbitration to resolve problems, we can appoint block producers, we can make changes to the chain.

And the point of all this is what we call smart business.
